;; Contract: lis_slow : list_of_numbers -> list_of_numbers
;; Purpose: to compute the greates non-descending subsequence of the input list in O(2^n) time
;; Example: (lis_slow `(1 2 3 4 1)) should produce (1 2 3 4)
;; Definition

;; Contract: lis_fast : list_of_numbers -> list_of_numbers
;; Purpose: to compute the greates non-descending subsequence of the input list in polynomial time
;; Example: (lis_fast `(1 2 3 4 1)) should produce (1 2 3 4)
